## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All the necessary libraries to run the code were already available in Anaconda distribution of Python. This script was written using Python version 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using text mining techniques to extract different types of date formats from medical records, standardizing them to a single format and ordering them in ascending chronological order.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1. Notebook - Jupyter Notebook with the script developed for extracting dates from the medical records.
2. Txt file - a copy of the medical record used for this notebook.
3. Licensing - MIT License covering this project.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The result is a pandas Series with the index of the dates extracted in ascending chronological order.
